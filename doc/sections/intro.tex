\section{Defining Problem}
In the Maze problem, our goal is to 
start from a point and reach some goal 
point bypassing obstacles through the way. 
To represent the maze map, we are using a grid map. 
Grid maps represent every point that agents can be by 
a square with some specific color and obstacles with 
another color.
